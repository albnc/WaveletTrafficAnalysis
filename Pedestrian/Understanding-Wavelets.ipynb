    "Types:\n",
    "- DWT - Discrete Wavelet Transform\n",
    "- CWT - Continuous Wavelet Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference is not about the signal type, it is  the 'a' (scale) and 'b' (translation) factors are continuous or discrete values, i.e. the CWT could estimate a pattern in differents periods of time from discrete values in power of 2.\n",
